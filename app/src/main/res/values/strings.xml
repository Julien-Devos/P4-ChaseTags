    <string name="tutorial_desc_3">When you create a game, you can set it up as you wish.

You can also set the duration of the game, choose how the game ends or even choose between 2 game modes.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_desc_4">When a game is created, your friends can join it using the game code given to you. You don\'t need an account to join a game, you just need a nickname and the game code. Once all players are in the game you can start the game. Be careful once the game has started, you can\'t join it anymore!</string>
    <string name="tutorial_desc_5">As the organizer, you can see the timer and the points of each player. As a player you have to look for the hidden Runes and once found, scan them or enter them depending on the type of Rune.\nHave fun on ChaseTags!</string>
